# Book Review Application

This project is a server-side online book review application integrated with a secure REST API server that uses session-level authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The application allows users to store, retrieve, and manage book ratings and reviews. 

## Project Scenario

In this project, you will take on the role of a back-end developer working for an online retailer that sells books. Your task is to develop a server-side application with the following features and capabilities:

- Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
- Search for specific books and retrieve their details based on the book's ISBN code, author names, and titles
- Retrieve reviews/comments for specified books
- Register as a new user of the application
- Login to the application
- Add a new review for a book (only available for logged-in users)
- Modify a book review (only logged-in users can modify their own reviews)
- Delete a book review (only logged-in users can delete their own reviews)
- Allow multiple users to access the application simultaneously, view, and manage different book reviews

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Promises or Async-Await for handling asynchronous operations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure the application by setting the required environment variables.
4. Run the application using `npm start`.
5. Access the application in your web browser at the specified URL.
